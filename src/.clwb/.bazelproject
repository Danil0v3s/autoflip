# This is a projectview file generated automatically during bazel project auto-import 
# For more documentation, please visit https://ij.bazel.build/docs/project-views.html
# If your repository contains predefined .projectview files, you use 'import' directive to include them.
# Otherwise, please specify 'directories' and 'targets' you want to be imported
 
# By default, we keep the 'directories' section empty, so nothing is imported.
# Specify the source directories you wish to include in the 'directories' section.
# 
# After that, please look at the `derive_targets_from_directories` section and then:
#   - either keep it set to `true` to import ALL targets in the directories section
#   - or set it to `false` and add `targets` section to choose the targets selectively

# directories: 
#   Specify the source directories to be imported here
